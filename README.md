### Phase 1 Project Template using Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

### Project Overview
This project aims to provide actionable insights to Microsoft's new movie studio by exploring the types of films that are currently performing best at the box office. The goal is to analyze various movie datasets and generate valuable insights that will help Microsoft's movie studio in making informed decisions about the types of films they should create.



### Business Problem
Microsoft wants to venture into the film industry by creating an original movie studio. However, they lack expertise in the movie-making process. The task is to explore the current movie market and identify the characteristics of successful films. The insights gained from the analysis will guide Microsoft in making strategic decisions regarding the genres, budgets, and other attributes of the movies they should produce.



### The Data
The project utilizes movie datasets from various sources such as Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, TheMovieDB, and The Numbers. The relevant datasets for this analysis are:
imdb.title.basics: Contains basic information about movie titles, including genres and release years.
imdb.title.ratings: Provides movie ratings and the number of votes from IMDB users.
bom.movie_gross: Includes information about movie titles, studio names, domestic and worldwide gross revenue.



### Approach
Data Collection: The relevant datasets will be obtained from the provided sources and loaded for analysis.
Data Cleaning: The datasets will be cleaned to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and format data for analysis.


### Data Integration:
Relevant columns from different datasets will be merged to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Various visualizations and statistical analysis will be conducted to explore movie genres, ratings, revenue, and other attributes.

### Findings and Recommendations: 
The insights gained from the analysis will be presented to Microsoft's movie studio head, along with actionable recommendations for movie production.

### Deliverables
Jupyter Notebook: The analysis and code will be presented in a Jupyter Notebook, detailing the data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and insights derived.
Visualizations: Various plots will be created to visualize the movie data and present the findings effectively.

### Report: 
A detailed report will summarize the key findings, recommendations, and insights from the analysis through presentation.

### Conclusion
This project aims to help Microsoft's movie studio in understanding the current movie market landscape and making data-driven decisions to produce successful films. Through exploratory data analysis, we will uncover patterns and trends that can guide the studio in creating appealing and profitable movies.
